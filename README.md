# Deep Sequential Models for Twitter Threads Sentiment Analysis

## Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis on Twitter threads using deep sequential models, specifically **Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM)** and **Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Network (Bi-RNN)**. The dataset comprises labeled Twitter threads, which are preprocessed and trained using deep learning techniques.
